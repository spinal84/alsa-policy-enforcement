ALSA Policy Enforcement Daemon (alsaped)
----------------------------------------

The purpose of the daemon is to set ALSA controls according to the rules which
are read from a config file.

The logic of the program is simple:
1. Read config file
2. Set ALSA controls to default values
3. Listen on D-Bus for events to react
4. Modify ALSA controls according to the rules

It's obvious that this daemon is not very useful when running standalone. To
make it useful you may want to add configuration file and use a program that
will provide alsaped with events to react on. In Maemo Fremantle such program
was OHM (Open Hardware Manager).
