ALSA Policy Enforcement Daemon (alsaped)
----------------------------------------

The purpose of the daemon is to set ALSA controls according to the rules which
are read from a config file.

The logic of the program is simple:
1. Read config file
2. Set ALSA controls to default values
3. Listen on D-Bus for events to react
4. Modify ALSA controls according to the rules

It's obvious that this daemon is not very useful when running standalone. To
make it useful you may want to add configuration file and use a program that
will provide alsaped with events to react on. In Maemo Fremantle such program
was OHM (Open Hardware Manager).

Q: How can I check if alsaped is doing anything useful?
A: The answer below fits to Maemo Fremantle.
   Start playing music. Put on your headphones. Attach/detach the headphones to
   Nokia N900 while the music is playing. Try to do it with and without alsaped
   running. To start/stop the daemon in Maemo Fremantle use these commands:
   # start alsaped
   # stop alsaped
   Two things you can notice while doing the above when alsaped is not running:
   1. Absence of sound from speakers or headphones. This depends on what route
      was active when you turned alsaped off.
   2. Presense of quiet sound on headphones attach. This can be noticed if
      alsaped was stopped while the sound was routed to headphones.

TODO:
 - Add explanations to the head sections of source files
 - Remove "bugfix" comments, "Bug?"
 - Remove comments like "TODO:" from sources
 - Remove comments like "FIXME:" from sources
 - Add sections to README: how to configure, how to run, how to test
